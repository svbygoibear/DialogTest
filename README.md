# Office-Addin-TaskPane-React

This repository is based off of the code generated by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office). 
It shows a simple example of opening up a dialog from the taskpane and sending a message back to the taskpane parent to close the dialog itself.

## TypeScript

This repository is written using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). For the JavaScript version of this template, go to [Office-Addin-TaskPane-React-JS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-TaskPane-React-JS).

- [Attach a debugger from the task pane](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/attach-debugger-from-task-pane)
- [Use F12 developer tools on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-f12-developer-tools-on-windows-10)

## Issues

#### Current Issues
With this repository, we can showcase that using Outlook Online exhibits unexpected behaviour;
- The **dialog** can't send a message back to the parent; we make use of the **Office.context.ui.messageParent** method, send a **#Close** message to the parent which is not recieved by the parent.

#### Previous Issues
~~With this repository, we can showcase that using any office product online and loading in our application in either Safari on Mac OR in a private Edge window:~~
- ~~The **localStorage** is not shared between the taskpane and the **dialog**~~.
- ~~The **dialog** can't send a message back to the parent; we make use of the **Office.context.ui.messageParent** method, send a **#Close** message to the parent which is not recieved by the parent~~. 
~~Both of these issues work on Chrome, Firefox, IE10 and Edge (in regular mode)~~.
- ~~The **localStorage** event listener is not triggered from an external window for Edge in Private:~~
